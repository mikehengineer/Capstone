# Capstone
Senior Capstone Project.  Real time home automation/monitoring web service programmed in Node.js and javascript.

This is a webserver that I coded using node.js.  The entire stack is written in javascript including the database logic (SQL.js).

The server was hosted on a beaglebone black microcomputer (Debian OS) with a series of temperature/light sensors and two micro servos.  

The beaglebone black had a WiFi dongle and a user could access the server from anywhere in the world and view temperature/light values,
move the servo arms, and generate highcharts based on the SQLite3 database.

On the frontend I used HTML/CSS/JQuery to create a one page design that allowed the environment sensors to update the HTML DOM in realtime.

If you have any questions regarding this project or if you'd like to use snippets of my code please contact me at mikehengineer@gmail.com
